# Building the Web of Tomorrow: A Case Study

A talk on how web standards are built, originally written in October 2012. This version was updated in January 2013 for Developer Week.
The talk uses some work done at Adobe as an example of how an idea moves on to become a W3C specification and browser implementation.
